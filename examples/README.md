# Pandoc lua logging examples

This directory contains example lua files (standalone and pandoc filters) and some sample markdown files.

These files were used when generating the examples in the top-level README file.

There's also a `Makefile` that runs lua and pandoc (as appropriate) and compares the output with the expected output.
